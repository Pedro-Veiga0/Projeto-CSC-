# Deep Learning for Image Classification  
**University Project (Universidade do Minho)**

## üìå Overview
This project explores deep learning techniques for image classification across three datasets of increasing complexity: **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **Stanford Dogs**. A variety of neural network architectures were implemented, including:

- Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)
- Vision Transformers (ViT)
- Transfer Learning with InceptionV3, ResNet50, and ViT-B16-FE

The objective was to evaluate performance across these datasets and models, optimizing via hyperparameter tuning and data preprocessing techniques.

## üìÇ Datasets
1. **CIFAR-10**  
   - 10 classes (animals & vehicles)  
   - 32√ó32 resolution images  
   - Balanced dataset

2. **CIFAR-100**  
   - 100 fine-grained classes grouped into 20 superclasses  
   - 32√ó32 resolution  
   - More complex and less separable than CIFAR-10

3. **Stanford Dogs**  
   - 120 dog breeds  
   - High-resolution images (224√ó224)  
   - Real-world class imbalance and visual similarity

## üß† Architectures
- **MLP:** Simple 3-layer model, used as a performance baseline  
- **CNN:** Custom models with/without data augmentation (horizontal flip, zoom, rotation)  
- **LSTM:** Applied to reshaped image data for sequence modeling  
- **Vision Transformer (ViT):** Patch-based transformer encoder  
- **Transfer Learning:**  
  - `InceptionV3`  
  - `ResNet50`  
  - `ViT-B16-FE` (via `tensorflow_hub`)

---

## üß™ Optimization
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  - Grid Search  
  - Random Search  
  - Hyperband (preferred due to efficiency)
- **Cross-Validation:**  
  Used 5-fold cross-validation for performance validation, especially on CNN and InceptionV3.
